# Godot RPG Database
RPG database for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) inspired on RPG Maker's database editor made in GDScript, originally based on the [C# implementation by sdtv9507](https://github.com/sdtv9507/RPG-Databases)

## How to use

- Copy the folder rpg_database from the project in "res://addons/".
- Create a new folder in the root of your project called "databases" (without the quotes).
- Go to your project's Settings and enable the plugin.
- A button should show above the inspector. Press it to open the database

Feel free to open an issue if you have problems or a feature request
